# Wayback Analysis

For my Wayback Analysis I chose the New York Times’s website. I think websites typically aim to have organized and simple layouts with concise titles, labels, and links. With the main interest being to not overwhelm or confuse users. Both versions of the New York Time website had these elements, but there were a couple of differences I noticed.

I chose a screenshot from August 29, 2005 to observe and the most unusual thing for me was how compact the information was on the page. Screen formats were typically narrower at the time, so it can be expected, but it is a big contrast to the current website where information is spread out far more. 
Another difference was the use of pictures on the current website. For each subsection, like sports or entertainment, at least one article is accompanied by a photo associated with the title. To add on, the current website also has brief descriptions or summaries for some of the articles. Relying on the idea that as the reader, if you want more details you’ll click on the link, in other words the title, provided. Whereas, in the 2005 version, few photos were used and even fewer descriptions were provided. They relied heavily on using captivating titles to draw readers in. 

Overall, the only out of ordinary thing I found for the website, in comparison to now, was the compact format of information and less use of visual aids. All the information was crammed into a tighter space making it feel a bit more cluttered then I am currently used to. With all that said, I personally enjoyed the blast from the past as a modern user. It was cool to be reminded how certain websites looked back in the early 2000s.
