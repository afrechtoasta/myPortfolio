# Wayback Analysis

For my Wayback Analysis I chose the New York Times’s website. I think websites typically aim to have organized and simple layouts with concise titles, labels, and links. With the main interest being to not overwhelm or confuse users. Both versions of the New York Time website had these elements, but there were a couple of differences I noticed.

I chose a screenshot from August 29, 2005 to observe and the most unusual thing for me was how compact the information was on the page. Screen formats were typically narrower at the time, so it can be expected, but it is a big contrast to the current website where information is spread out far more. 
Another difference was the use of pictures on the current website. For each subsection, like sports or entertainment, at least one article is accompanied by a photo associated with the title. To add on, the current website also has brief descriptions or summaries for some of the articles. Relying on the idea that as the reader, if you want more details you’ll click on the link, in other words the title, provided. Whereas, in the 2005 version, few photos were used and even fewer descriptions were provided. They relied heavily on using captivating titles to draw readers in. 

Overall, the only out of ordinary thing I found for the website, in comparison to now, was the compact format of information and less use of visual aids. All the information was crammed into a tighter space making it feel a bit more cluttered then I am currently used to. With all that said, I personally enjoyed the blast from the past as a modern user. It was cool to be reminded how certain websites looked back in the early 2000s.

Prompt C:
For this reflective blog, I asked Copilot to generate a project plan for a developing cybersecurity system. I plan on going into cybersecurity when I graduate and hope to be a project manager one day. Project managers are tasked with multiple things and are responsible for lots of documentation. 

The original prompt I asked was, “Imagine you are a project manager. Could you provide an example of a project plan for a cybersecurity system being developed?”, to which the AI presented a rough outline of a project plan. The project plan was broken into nine categories, Project Overview, Project Goals and Objectives, Project Scope, Key Deliverables, Timeline and Milestones, Budget, Risk Management, Stakeholders (Team members), and Communication Plan. Each category had vague examples or descriptions to correspond with it. In conclusion, the results were a good example of a potential project plan, but there were still things that could be improved. 

The first improvement needed is vital categories not present in the original project plan, which include ‘Quality Criteria’, ‘Evaluating Criteria’, and ‘Procurement/Contracting Plan’. The first two would be used to help guide the testing stage of the system to give a clear outline of what the system should accomplish and what to do if the goals are not accomplished. Time was allocated in the ‘Timeline and Milestone’ category in the plan for testing, but no criteria were given for it. The last category represents what outside resources need to be acquired to develop the system, like supplies or other manual labor. Another improvement needed is less vague language and more specifics. Like stating the responsibilities of team members and what is included in each expense category. 

Therefore, my follow-up prompt was, “Could you include a ‘Quality Criteria’, ‘Evaluating Criteria’, and 'Procurement or Contracting Plan' in it. Plus please be more specific, like stating the responsibilities of team members and what is included in each expense category.” The results were improved versions of the original project plan, taking note of my suggestions. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but I think it is a great draft.

To save space on the page I have included my questions and Copilot's responses in this document, [Copilot Responses.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18897954/Copilot.Responses.pdf)


AI Check: I used Grammarly to improve my assignment and Copilot for the assignment itself.
