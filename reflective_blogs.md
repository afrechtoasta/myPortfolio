# Wayback Analysis

For my Wayback Analysis I chose the New York Times’s website. I think websites typically aim to have organized and simple layouts with concise titles, labels, and links. With the main interest being to not overwhelm or confuse users. Both versions of the New York Time website had these elements, but there were a couple of differences I noticed.

I chose a screenshot from August 29, 2005 to observe and the most unusual thing for me was how compact the information was on the page. Screen formats were typically narrower at the time, so it can be expected, but it is a big contrast to the current website where information is spread out far more. 
Another difference was the use of pictures on the current website. For each subsection, like sports or entertainment, at least one article is accompanied by a photo associated with the title. To add on, the current website also has brief descriptions or summaries for some of the articles. Relying on the idea that as the reader, if you want more details you’ll click on the link, in other words the title, provided. Whereas, in the 2005 version, few photos were used and even fewer descriptions were provided. They relied heavily on using captivating titles to draw readers in. 

Overall, the only out of ordinary thing I found for the website, in comparison to now, was the compact format of information and less use of visual aids. All the information was crammed into a tighter space making it feel a bit more cluttered then I am currently used to. With all that said, I personally enjoyed the blast from the past as a modern user. It was cool to be reminded how certain websites looked back in the early 2000s.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
