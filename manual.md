# What is the Sims 4? 
*The Sims 4* is a life-simulator game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The game was originally released on September 2, 2014 for Windows and is the latest installment in the *SimsCity* franchise that first started on February 4, 2000 with the original game, *The Sims*. *The Sims 4*, like the previous versions of the game, allows players to create and control the lives of virtual people. Players can guide characters through everyday activities, personal aspirations, relationships, and more. Being the most recent version, *The Sims 4* offers enhanced graphics and mechanics compared to the predecessors allowing a better overall experience for users. Regular updates and releases of expansion packs allow new and exciting things to enhance the game. 

One aspect of *The Sims 4* users enjoy is the ability to modify the game using something called [Custom Content (CC)](#Glossary) and [Mods](#Glossary). Customs Content and Mods can be found online and are usually created by other users to help enhance the game even more. Though it can be exciting and fun, it's important to do it properly to avoid messing up the game. So this manual acts as a guide on how to properly do it.

# Where to finds CC and Mods

There are multiple places you can find CC or Mods for your game, but make sure you research the different places you can find CC and Mods and undertand the possible risk you take when downloading from places you don't do your reasearch on. Certain websites can be unsafe and files might not be what they appear to be. Not only putting your game at risk but your computer's securtiy. 
Luckily there are some common places known by many users where you an share and get cc from like [The Sims Resource (TSR)](<https://www.thesimsresource.com/>) and [ModTheSims](<https://modthesims.info/>). Other options are social media platforms like Tumblr or Pinterest, where the creators themselves will post their creations, but again it's important to insure that the independent creators are trustworthy.

# Downloading your CC and Mods

Like iterated in, ['Where to finds CC and Mods'](#Wher-to-finds-CC-and-Mods), when on websites and social media platforms it's important to exercise online safety. Avoid clicking on ads or things that have nothing to do with the purpose of you on that website or platform. Downloading Ad blockers extensions on your browser can help protect yourself when search online. 

![Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d087bd-3609-4520-85df-42fe1b7cb7ca)
*Figure 1*  
- Typically most websites provide easy and simple way to navigate downloading your desired CC, like the purple *Download* button in *Figure 1*.

*Firgure 3*  
- **Tip!** Oftentimes when you are about to click a link, in the bottom left of your browser you’ll see what exactly the link is. In *Figure 2* I’m on The Sims Resource (TSR) hovering over a pair of earrings I want for my game, clicking on this would take me to another page, but what is the said page? Well, in the bottom corner you’ll see the URL, which *Figure 3* provides a close up of.

# FAQ
***How do I access the EA App?***   
- To access the EA app, you first have to download it from the website, which can be found on the [EA wbsite]<https://www.ea.com/ea-app#downloads>.
![Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f044c2d-007a-4231-aeef-22abc05d544b)
Figure 1  
- After the software downloads, open the app. You will be greeted with a *Sign in to your EA Account* screen, as seen in *Figure 1*. Enter your credentials to access your account and if you need to set one up click *Create Account*

***How do I extract my files after downloading them?***

Depending on the type of file, there is two different processes.

*.zip files*:  
For zip files both*Windows* and *MacOS* have built-in software that allows you to extract these types of files.
- For *MacOS*, locate your file in *Finder* and double-click on the file. It’ll automatically extract the file and create a new folder for it in the same location. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.
- For *Windows*, locate your file in *File explorer* and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option *Extract All*, click on that. A window will pop up asking you to choose the location for the extracted files, by default it extracts to the same folder as the .zip. Once you’ve decided the location click *Extract*. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.

*For .RAR or .7z:*  
For these types of files you’ll need to download a software that will allow you to extract the file, an example is [WinRAR](<https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0>)  or [The Unarchiver](<https://theunarchiver.com/>). 
- For *MacOS* locate your file in Finder and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option Open With > The Unarchiver, click on that. The software will then extract the file and create a new folder containing that contents. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.
- For *Windows* locate your file in File explorer and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option Extract to [folder name of file], click on that. The software will then extract the file and create a new folder, with the same name, containing that contents. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script. 

***I’ve installed some CC/Mods and now my game is not working?***  

Sometimes after adding CC or Mods into your game, the game doesn't work. The is usually something wrong like compatibility issues, example you've downloaded CC for *The Sims 3* instead of *The Sims 4*, or the CC itself can be broken and cause your game not to work. Sadly, there is no easy way to figure out which file it is, which can be a pain if you have a lot off CC and Mods in your game. However, there is a method you can apply to help figure out which file it could be. 
 - Think back to the last time your game was working. Let us say, for example, that your game was working two days ago. Within the two days, think about how much CC you've downloaded. Again lets say you've only downloaded 3 files in the two day span, then it's probably one of those 3 files. Remove all three files and one by one add them back into the game, whichever one crashes the game is probably the cause. 

***I’ve updated my game and now my CC and Mods are not working?***  
Often when CC and Mods are create they are created to be compatable with the lastest version of the game at the time. As *The Sims 4* updates, the CC/Mods need to be updated too. Remove the current version of the CC/Mods not working from your game and find the updated version compatable with the updated game.
