# What is the Sims 4? 
*The Sims 4* is a life-simulator game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The game was originally  released on September 2, 2014 for Windows and is the latest installment in the *SimsCity* franchise that first started on February 4, 2000 with the original game, *The Sims*. *The Sims 4*, like the previous versions of the game, allows players to create and control the lives of virtual people.

Being the most recent version, *The Sims 4* offers enhanced graphics and mechanics compared to the predecessors allowing a better overall experience for users. Regular updates and releases of expansion packs allow new and exciting things to enhance the game. 

One aspect of *The Sims 4* users enjoy is the ability to modify the game using something called Custom Content (CC) and Mods. Customs Content and Mods can be found anywhere online and is usually created by other users to help enhance the game even more. Though it can be exciting and fun, it's important to do it properly to avoid messing up the game. So this manual acts as a guide on how to properly do it.

# Where to finds CC and Mods

There are multiple places you can find CC or Mods, but you must research and download at your own risk. Certain websites can be unsafe and files might not be what they appear to be. Common places many users check are websites like The Sims Resource (TSR) (<https://www.thesimsresource.com/>) and ModTheSims (<https://modthesims.info/>). Other options are social media platforms like Tumblr or Pinterest, where the creators themselves will post their creations.

# Downloading your CC and Mods

When on websites and social media platforms it's important to exercise online safety. Avoid clicking on ads or things that have nothing to do with the purpose of you on that website or platform. Downloading Ad blockers extensions on your browser can help protect yourself when search online. 

![*Figure 1*: Home page for The Sims Resource](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53827684-8e39-47d4-b738-6ac0521199f1)
![*Figure 2*: Close up of the link in Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b90e7dd-40c9-4fe7-9b9a-976212b54be3)

**Tip!** Oftentimes when you are about to click a link, in the bottom left of your browser you’ll see what exactly the link is. In *Figure 1* I’m on The Sims Resource (TSR) hovering over a pair of earrings I want for my game, clicking on this would take me to another page, but what is the said page? Well, in the bottom corner you’ll see the URL, which *Figure 2* provides a close up of.

# How to install your CC and Mods 
**Extracting files**
After downloading your file, you’ll possibly need to extract the file. 
 1. Navigate to File Explorer on Windows and Finder on MacOS. Once there, find the ‘Download’ section and click on it.
 2. Find the file you downloaded and click on it to highlight it.
 3. You’ll notice that each file has information about it broken into columns, like Name, Size, Date Added or Date Modified. We are looking at the column titled either Type or Kind. So focusing on your highlighted file find the Type and Kind for the file
 4. If you see .package, .ts4script, or .txt it won’t have to be extracted, so you can move to the next section.
 5. If you see .zip, .rar, or .7z, it’ll have to be extracted. Which can be found [here](#FAQ) in the FAQ section.
