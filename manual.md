# What is The Sims 4? 
*The Sims 4* is a life-simulator game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The game was originally released on September 2nd, 2014, for Windows and is the latest installment in the *SimsCity* franchise that first started on February 4th, 2000, with the original game, *The Sims*. *The Sims 4*, like the previous versions of the game, allows players to create and control the lives of virtual people. Players can guide characters through everyday activities, personal aspirations, relationships, and more. Being the most recent version, *The Sims 4* offers enhanced graphics and mechanics compared to the predecessors, allowing a better overall experience for users. Regular updates and releases of expansion packs allow new and exciting things to enhance the game. 

One aspect of *The Sims 4* users enjoy is the ability to modify the game using [Custom Content (CC)](##1-custom-content-cc-) and [Mods (Modifications)](#2-mods-modifications). Custom content and Mods can be found online and are usually created by other users to help enhance the game. Though CC and Mods can be exciting and fun, it's important to understand how to properly use them to avoid messing up the game. This manual acts as a guide on how to use CC and Mods.

# System Requirements and Installation
To begin, you will need to have *The Sims 4* downloaded on your personal computer, PC. This guide is only for PCs with *Windows* and *MacOS* as the operating system. There are a couple of ways to access and download *The Sims 4*, but for this guide, it will use the [EA app](#3-ea) to download the software to support the creators of *The Sims* franchise. 

## 1. Installing Sims 4 using the EA app:
First, open up the EA app. If you haven’t downloaded the app or created your account, check [here](#1-how-do-i-access-the-ea-app) in the FAQ for guidance on how to do that.

![Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e72df173-c297-46eb-89f9-0c3ebfcb380d)
*Figure 1* 

 - Once the app is open, on the left side you'll see four labels, *Home*, *Browse*, *Library*, *EA Play* as seen in *Figure 1*, click on *Library*.
 - If you own *The Sims 4*, you should be able to locate it in your *Library*. If you don't see it in your *Library*, it means you still need to purchase it.
 - To purchase the game, click on the search bar above *Library*, as seen in *Figure 1*, and search *The Sims 4*.
 - Once you have clicked on the game, you will see the option to purchase *The Sims 4*.
 - After purchasing the game, it will be added to your *Library*, migrate back to your *Library* and find *The Sims 4*.
 - Click on the game, and then click on the option to *Download*.

## 2. **Tip!**   

![Figure 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9590af9f-f09c-4f09-b145-9208d723814c)
*Figure 2*  

 - You'll notice a tab that says *Bundle & Save*. Say you have been eyeing expansion packs to change your gameplay. Throughout the year, deals will occur that ultimately save money by bundling expansion packs together. Check often to see if there is a sale on an expansion packs.


![Figure 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa8ec17e-65ed-442d-854c-6d058d3efcb4)   
*Figure 3*  

 - The game should begin to download, which you can see in the bottom left corner of the screen in *Figure 3*. [My game is currently updating, so it says updating rather than downloading.] When it's finished, the game should automatically install onto your PC
 - To start the game, open the EA app, migrate to the *Library*, click on *The Sims 4*. Click the *Play* button to start the game.

## 3. Alternative source for installing *The Sims 4*   
There are multiple ways to download *The Sims 4*. If you are unable to download the game via the EA app, another option is through [Steam](#4-steam). Though it is a different platform, the instructions to download the 
*The Sims 4* through Steam is relatively similar. The software can be found [here](<https://store.steampowered.com/about/>).

# Where to find CC and Mods

## 1. Safety When Searching 
There are multiple places you can find CC or Mods for your game. Common choices are websites or social media. When searching online, you must understand the possible risk you take when downloading from places you don't know well. Certain websites can be unsafe, and files may not be as they appear. Not only putting your game at risk, but your computer's security at risk. 

Safe Habits:

   - Find user reviews or community discussions about different websites. A great resource is the discussion board for *The Sims 4* on the [EA website](<https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en>). In the discussion board, you can find all types of information, not just about CC and Mods. Another resource is [*The Sims 4* Mods community](<https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSims4Mods/>) on Reddit.
   - Avoid files that say *.exe*, which is an executable file. When you double-click on it, it informs your computer to run a program embedded in the file. For *The Sims 4*, .exe files are not needed. Make sure to avoid them. If you accidentally download one, delete it. Remember not to double-click during the deletion process. To know what type of files you should see, check the [types or kind of files section](#2-The-Type-or-Kind-of-File)

Luckily, there are some common places known by many users where you can share and get CC from.

## 2. Popular CC Sources
   1. [The Sims Resource (TSR)](<https://www.thesimsresource.com/>) is a well-known place that serves as a platform for other players who have created CC to share. You can find CC for *The Sims 1, 2, 3, and 4* on the website.
   2. [ModTheSims](<https://modthesims.info/>) is another popular platform, like TSR, that provides CC for *The Sims 1, 2, 3, and 4*.

Some other options are social media platforms like [Tumblr](<https://www.tumblr.com/>) or [Pinterest](<https://www.pinterest.com/>), where the creators will post their creations. It is important to ensure that the independent creators are trustworthy. Remember to do your research.

# Downloading your CC and Mods

As iterated in [Safety When Searching](#1-Safety-When-Searching), it is important to exercise online safety. Avoid clicking on ads unrelated to your purpose on that website or platform. Downloading Ad blocker extensions on your browser can help protect yourself when searching online. 

![Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d087bd-3609-4520-85df-42fe1b7cb7ca)
*Figure 4*  

- Typically, most websites provide an easy and simple way to navigate to downloading your desired CC, like the purple *Download* button in *Figure 4*.

## 1. *Tip!*

![Figure 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53827684-8e39-47d4-b738-6ac0521199f1)  
*Figure 5*  

![Figure 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b90e7dd-40c9-4fe7-9b9a-976212b54be3)  
*Figure 6*  

When on a website, before you click a link on the page, in the bottom left corner of your browser, you'll find a preview of the link. In *Figure 5*, I’m on The Sims Resource (TSR) hovering over a pair of earrings I want for my game. Clicking on this would take me to another page, which *Figure 6* provides a close-up of.

# How to install your CC and Mods 
Once you've downloaded your CC it is time to install it into the game. First, the file needs to be extracted. 

## 1. Extracting Files 
  - Navigate to File Explorer on Windows and Finder on MacOS. Once there, find the ‘Download’ section and click on it.
  - Find the file you downloaded and right-click to highlight it.
  - You’ll notice that each file has information about it broken into columns, like *Name*, *Size*, *Date Added*, or *Date Modified*. Based on your operating system, the column to focus on is titled either *Type* or *Kind*. 

## 2. The Type or Kind of File 
  - Note what it says in the *Type* or *Kind* column.
  - If you see .package, .ts4script, or .txt, it won’t have to be extracted; move to the next section.
  - If you see .zip, .rar, or .7z, it will have to be extracted. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](#2-how-do-i-extract-my-files-after-downloading-them) in the FAQ section.
  - Once the file has been extracted, it is time to place the file into the game. Select the file and press either Command + C or Ctrl + X.

## 3. Installing CC Into Game For *Windows*:  
   - Open up *File Explorer*
   - On the left hand you'll see *This PC*, click on it, then you'll locate *Windows(C:)* and double click on that.

   - Now find the folder titled after your username, and double-click on that
   - Find the folder titled *Documents*, double-click on that
   - Click on the folder titled *Electronic Arts*, double-click on that
   - Finally find the folder titled *Mods*, double click on that
   - Once there, paste the file in the folder by hitting Ctrl + V

## 4. Installing CC Into Game For *MacOS*:

   - Find the folder titled *Documents*, double-click on that
   - Click on the folder titled *Electronic Arts*, double-click on that
   - Finally find the folder titled *Mods*, double click on that
   - Once there, paste the document in the folder by hitting Command + V


## 5. **Tip!**
   - Create folders within your game to help organize your CC and Mods. It'll help if you're looking for a certain CC file, especially if it's broken and you need to remove it.

# Checking to make sure CC and Mods are working  
- Open the EA app, migrate to the Library, click on The Sims 4, and click the *Play* button to start the game.

*Figure 7*

- You will be presented with the *Menu*, find the *Game Options* option and click on it. Which you can see highlighted in *Figure 7*.

If you don't see this message no worries, check to see if your changes were successfully saved. If they weren't just repeat these steps. 

If your game is not working, for example, stuck on the loading page, check FAQ [here](#3-ive-installed-some-ccmods-and-now-my-game-is-not-working).

# FAQ
## 1. ***How do I access the EA App?***   
- To access the EA app, you first have to download it from the website, which can be found on the [EA website](<https://www.ea.com/ea-app#downloads>)

![Figure 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f044c2d-007a-4231-aeef-22abc05d544b)
*Figure 13*

- After the software downloads, open the app. You will be greeted with a *Sign in to your EA Account* screen, as seen in *Figure 13*. Enter your credentials to access your account and if you need to set one up click *Create Account*

## 2. ***How do I extract my files after downloading them?***

Depending on the type of file, there are two different processes.

*.zip files*:  
For zip files, both *Windows* and *MacOS* have built-in software that allows you to extract these types of files.
- For *MacOS*, locate your file in *Finder* and double-click on the file. It’ll automatically extract the file and create a new folder for it in the same location. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.
- For *Windows*, locate your file in *File explorer* and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option *Extract All*, click on that. A window will pop up asking you to choose the location for the extracted files, by default, it extracts to the same folder as the .zip. Once you’ve decided the location, click *Extract*. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.

*For .RAR or .7z:*  
For these types of files, you’ll need to download a software that will allow you to extract the file, an example is [WinRAR](<https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0>)  or [The Unarchiver](<https://theunarchiver.com/>). 
- For *MacOS* locate your file in Finder and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option *Open With > The Unarchiver*, click on that. The software will then extract the file and create a new folder containing that content. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script.
- For *Windows* locate your file in File Explorer and right-click on the file. You’ll see the option Extract to [folder name of file], click on that. The software will then extract the file and create a new folder, with the same name, containing that contents. Click on the folder and you should find the contents of the file, ie. the .package or .ts4script. 

## 3. ***I’ve installed some CC/Mods, and now my game is not working?***  

Sometimes, after adding CC or Mods into your game, the game doesn't work. The is usually something wrong like compatibility issues, for example you've downloaded CC for *The Sims 3* instead of *The Sims 4*, or the CC itself can be broken and cause your game not to work. Sadly, there is no easy way to figure out which file it is, which can be a pain if you have a lot off CC and Mods in your game. However, there is a method you can apply to help figure out which file it could be. 
 - Think back to the last time your game was working. Let us say, for example, that your game was working two days ago. Within the two days, think about how much CC you've downloaded. Again let's say you've only downloaded 3 files in the two day span, then it's probably one of those 3 files. Remove all three files and one by one add them back into the game, whichever one crashes the game is probably the cause. 

## 4. ***I’ve updated my game, and now my CC and Mods are not working?***  

Often when CC and Mods are create,d they are created to be compatible with the latest version of the game at the time. As *The Sims 4* updates, the CC/Mods need to be updated too. Remove the current version of the CC/Mods not working from your game and find the updated version compatible with the updated game. Often if you look up the title of the CC you should be able to find the creator.
