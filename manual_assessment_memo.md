# Manual Assessment Memo

MEMORANDUM 
TO: HP
FROM: Alisa Crawford
SUBJECT: Recommendations for Maintenance and Service Guide 
DATE: February 13th, 2025


I evaluated the manual for HP 17 -cp2147ng available at: https://www.manua.ls/hp/17-cp2147ng/manual  

A significant number of strengths are apparent in the manual. Well-organized content with a clear table of contents and index. Detailed explanation and specifications of the computer hardware and what it does. Specific spare part product numbers for the various major components of the laptop. Comprehensive instructions and knowledge on what to do, and not do, to properly care for or replace components of the laptop.As well as, the systems that help the laptop function. 

Though the manual is good, there are a few weaknesses. Throughout the manual, in certain subsections, the phrase “select products only” is used without clarifying what the ‘select products’ are or how users can find if they have a ‘select product’. Certain instructions are given without clarification on how to access them or use them. For example, under Restoring and recovery methods, page 64, “1. Run a Microsoft System Restore”. The user is informed on what Microsoft System Restore is, but not how to access it or how to run the restore themselves.

My recommendations:
- Clarification on what models certain details in the manual apply to, and what models they don’t. 
- Clarification on how to perform certain tasks within instructions of subsections
