## About Me 
Hello! My name is Alisa Crawford. I am an Undergraduate at the University of Central Florida getting my B.S. in Information Technology. With the skills I develop through my degree and future experience in the work field, I plan to have an enriching career in Cyber Security. My coursework has helped me build numerous skills and understand the security of operating systems. I am also currently in the process of obtaining my CompTIA Security+ certification to enrich my knowledge even more.
