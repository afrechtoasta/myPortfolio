# Chatbot
The purpose of my chatbot is to help with sewing. I like to craft in my free time and I am constantly running into problems and questions I waste so much time researching to find answers to. So I decided to create a bot that saves me time and can not only answer my questions but also collaborate with me on my ideas. The chatbotâ€™s personality is cheerful and eager to help. I made this bot using Boodlebox.
